# ExtremeWordle
This is a [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) variant that has various difficulty levels and was built using Java 18.0.1 for the back-end and Java Swing for the front-end. Information regarding Wordle can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle).

The wordle answer chosen by the program (which the user will then try to guess) is a random five letter word which is selected from a list of English words sorted by the number of times they occur in a large English corpus. This list was created by Peter Norvig (who served as the director of research at Google) who wrote an [article](http://norvig.com/mayzner.html) about the research. Norvig's list is based on the Google books Ngrams data set, which compiles word counts from all books scanned by Google. Norvig's list was imported as this [.txt file](https://norvig.com/google-books-common-words.txt). Each of the 5 difficulty levels chooses from 20% of the 5-letter words, with the most common 20% selected for easy mode and the rarest 20% selected for extreme mode.
